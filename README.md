This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.8. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.


This project is a collection of examples for using the Clarifai OpenAI-compatible API with the `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` package.

This also includes tests to ensure that the examples work as expected. The tests require a valid Clarifai API key, which can be set in the `CLARIFAI_PAT` environment variable.
